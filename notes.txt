#Tracking your files

--Each file in your  working directory can be in one of the two states: tracked and untracked

--Trcaked files are files that Git knows about.
--Any file in your working directory that was not in your last snapshot and is not in your staging area is untracked files.

#below are the commands how to add file or how to stage file.

--for specific file
git add <file-name>

--for all files and folder
git add . (here dot always refers to current directory)


#commit changes

--moving files from stage area to the git folder is called commit.
--making commits, creates version/snapshots of your projects.

--committing changes
git commit -m "your commit message"
  here -m is flag which stands for message.


#Lifecycle of the status of a file:

untracked --> unmodified  --> modified  --> stage

if you do commit to staged file,it becomes unmodified.

Note: once you have made some changes to the file, make sure to add that file again to stage area otherwise commit would not happen. Git 
      will not able to understand the changes you have made to that file.
